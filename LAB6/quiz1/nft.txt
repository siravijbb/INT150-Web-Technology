###What is NFT?

NFT means non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which are generally created using the same type of programming used for
cryptocurrencies. In simple terms these [cryptographic assets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency) 
are based on [blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain) technology. They cannot 
be exchanged or traded equivalently like other cryptographic assets.

Like Bitcoin or Ethereum. The term NFT clearly represents it can neither be replaced nor interchanged because 
it has unique properties. Physical currency and cryptocurrency are fungible, which means that they can be traded 
or exchanged for one another.

* The majority of NFTs reside on the [Ethereum cryptocurrency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum)'s blockchain,
 a distributed public ledger that records transactions.
* NFTs are individual tokens with valuable information stored in them.
* Because they hold a value primarily set by the market and demand, they can be bought and sold just like other 
physical types of art.
* NFTs' unique data makes it easy to verify and validate their ownership and the transfer of tokens between owners.

###What is NFT Used For?

People interested in Crypto-trading and people who like to collect artwork often use NFTs. Other than that, it has 
some other uses too like:

Digital Content - The most significant use of NFTs today is in digital content. Content creators see their profits 
enhanced by NFTs, as they power a creator economy where creators have the ownership of their content over to the 
platforms they use to publicize it.

Gaming Items - NFTs have garnered considerable interest from game developers. NFTs can provide a lot of benefits 
to the players. Normally, in an online game, you can buy items for your character, but that’s as far as it goes. 
With NFTs, you can recoup your money by selling the items once you’re finished with them.

Investment and Collaterals - Both NFT and DeFi (Decentralized Finance) share the same infrastructure. DeFi applications 
let you borrow money by using collateral. NFT and DeFi both work together to explore using NFTs as collateral instead.

Domain Names - NFTs provide your domain with an easier-to-remember name. This works like a website domain name, making 
its IP address more memorable and valuable, usually based on length and relevance.
